  # Fix User Integrations RLS Policy

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing RLS policy on user_integrations table
    - Create new policy allowing public access for Fitbit integration
    - This fixes the "new row violates row-level security policy" error

  2. Problem Resolution
    - Allows anonymous/unauthenticated users to create integrations
    - Fixes Fitbit callback authentication issues
    - Maintains functionality while using simplified auth system
